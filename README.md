Stay tuned. This will be a web-based GUI for 
[SeaGOAT](https://github.com/kantord/SeaGOAT),
an "AI-based" grep alternative.

You will be able to self-host this web based GUI on your infrastructure, or
even run it locally on a single machine.

It will allow you to query multiple repositories at the same time.
